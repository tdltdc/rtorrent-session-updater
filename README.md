This script updates the value of the `tied_to_file` variable in Rtorrent session files ({SHA1HASH}.torrent.rtorrent) after the Rtorrent `.session` directory has been moved to a different location.

It was written for my personal use. Training wheels not included. Reading and understanding the code and backing up your `.session` directory prior to execution is recommended.
